==============================

About
=====

These instructions where written using centos 7.6 and outline the bare minimum
to restore the files from this tape set. The backup software used is BURP 
(Backup Restore Program). Resources at the bottom.

Install Centos
==============

I used server with GUI

 - Partitioning

  - /boot 1G  
  - swap  4G
  - /    What ever is left

 - /var/spool/burp - is where the backup files are stored. Ensure you have
   enough space or mount additional storage to this directory. The backup
   servers original storage size was 20 TB.

Install Software
================

 1) For centos 7.6 install epel-release 

 .. code:: bash

    $ sudo yum install epel-release

 2) Install burp software

 .. code:: bash

    $ sudo yum install -y burp-client burp-doc burp-server

    a) Optional - You can copy the included directory “clientconfdir” 
       to "/etc/burp" this will contain all of the original servers client 
       configs so the new server can tie all the data from /var/spool/burp as 
       valid backups.

Create a New Client
===================

 1) Create a new client on either the burp server or another host: I will call 
    it “restore”.

 2) So, to add a client called 'restore', you would create a file on the server
    called /etc/burp/clientconfdir/restore . As a minimum, the file needs to 
    contain a line like this:
	
	- password = abcdefgh

	- Recommend using that password as it is the default.

Setup client
============

 - On either the server or remote host we must configure the 
   client file you will need to edit the client at /etc/burp/burp.conf so that 
   the 'cname' line matches the clientconfdir file name on the server, the 
   'password' line matches the its the clientconfdir file's contents, and the 
   'server' line contains the address of the server. In our example's case, 
   those three lines will look like this:

	- cname = restore
	- password = abcdefgh
	- server= 1.2.3.4 

    - “localhost” if you are setting the client up on the server 

Setup Client to Read and Restore
================================

 - If you want to read all backup as just the restore client there are two ways.
   You can simply rename each backup as “restore” one at a time and restore 
   your data eg.

 .. code:: bash

    $ Sudo mv /var/spool/burp/doccontrol /var/spool/burp/restore

  - Or edit the burp-server config located at /etc/burp/burp-server.conf
    Uncomment and edit this line at the bottom:  

	#restore_client = someclient
	
    - Change to 
	
	restore_client = restore

Setup Firewall
==============

 - Allow ports in firewall and start the burp server

   - Add ports 4971 and 5971 tcp to the firewall  

Start Server and Test
=====================

 1) Start the burp server

 .. code :: bash

    $ sudo burp -c /etc/burp/burp-server.conf

 2) Test connection from client, either remote or local by running

 .. code:: bash
	
    $ sudo burp -a l

 - The first time this is ran it will automatically generate the SSL keys 
   and add the client. 

Check and List Available Backups
================================

 - To list backup

 .. code:: bash

    $ sudo burp -a l

 - If you changed the “restore_client” line in the burp server config and you 
   are using said client you should be able to list and restore backups of any
   client.

 - To list backup of another client
	
 .. code:: bash

    $ sudo burp -C otherclient -a l

 - To performe any action as another client add -C otherclient 

 .. code:: bash 

    $ sudo burp -C doccontrol -a l

Restoring
=========

 - Some examples of restoring files from a client of choice

 -Restore a file from a selected backup to a folder of choice

 .. code:: bash

    $ Sudo burp -C doccontrol -a r -b 69 -r Doc_number_log_12-6-18-303.xlsx -d /tmp/restore

 - Restore select backup to a custom location

 .. code:: bash

   $ Sudo burp -C doccontrol -a r -b 69 /tmp/restore

 - Restore selected backup to original location
	
 .. code:: bash

    $ Sudo burp -C doccontrol -a r -b 69
